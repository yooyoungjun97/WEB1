    <h2>CSS</h2>

   <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS"target="_blank"title= "html5 speicification">>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</a> is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language 
        such as HTML.[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2] CSS is designed to enable 
        the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility; 
        provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting 
        by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .
        Css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
