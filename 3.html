    <h2>JavaScript</h2>
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript" target="_blank" title="JavaScript speicification">JavaScript,[10]</a> often abbreviated JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, 
        alongside HTML and CSS.[11] Over 97% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for web page behavior,[12] often incorporating 
        third-party libraries.[13] All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.
        JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[14] It has dynamic typing, 
        prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, 
        and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, 
        standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).</p>
