                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript" target="_blank" title="JavaScript speicification"><span class="js" id="first">JavaScript</span>,[10]</a> often abbreviated JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, 
                alongside HTML and CSS.[11] Over 97% of websites use <span class="js">JavaScript</span> on the client side for web page behavior,[12] often incorporating 
                third-party libraries.[13] All major web browsers have a dedicated <span class="js">JavaScript</span> engine to execute the code on users' devices.
                alongside<span>HTML</span>and<span>CSS</span> <span class="js">JavaScript</span> is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[14] It has dynamic typing, 
                prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, 
                and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, 
                standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).</p>
