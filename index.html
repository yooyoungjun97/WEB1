        >The World Wide Web (WWW)</a>, commonly known as the Web, is an information system where documents and other web resources are identified by
         Uniform Resource Locators , which may be interlinked by hyperlinks, and are accessible over the 
         Internet.[1][2] The resources of the Web are transferred via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), may be accessed by users by 
         a software application called a web browser, and are published by a software application called a web server. 
         The World Wide Web is not synonymous with the Internet, which pre-dated the Web in some form by over two decades and upon 
         the technologies of which the Web is built.</p>
